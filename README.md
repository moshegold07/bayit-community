## What is Bayit?

**Bayit** (בית — "Home" in Hebrew) is an open-source platform for entrepreneur communities. Members register, discover other founders, and connect based on shared interests and expertise.

### Features

- Entrepreneur registration with profile details (LinkedIn, website, expertise, what you do & need)
- Browse and search active members by name, domain, or city
- Admin panel: approve members, manage house rules, remove profiles
- Profile editing and deletion requests
- Dynamic business categories

---

## Quick Start (for contributors)

**No Firebase keys needed.** The app runs locally with Firebase Emulators.

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** (v18+)
- **Java Runtime** — required by Firebase Emulators
  ```bash
  # Ubuntu/Debian
  sudo apt install default-jre

  # macOS
  brew install openjdk
  ```

### 1. Fork & Clone

```bash
# Fork the repo on GitHub, then:
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/bayit-community.git
cd bayit-community
npm install
```

### 2. Start Local Dev Environment

Open **3 terminals**:

```bash
# Terminal 1 — Start Firebase Emulators
npm run emulators

# Terminal 2 — Seed test data (only needed once)
npm run seed

# Terminal 3 — Start the app
npm run dev:app
```

### 3. Open in Browser

- **App:** [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173)
- **Emulator UI:** [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000) (browse the local DB)

### Test Accounts (local emulator)

| Role | Email | Password |
|------|-------|----------|
| Admin | admin@bayit.dev | admin123 |
| User | dana@bayit.dev | test1234 |
| Pending | pending1@bayit.dev | test1234 |

## How to Contribute

### Workflow

```
Fork → Clone → Branch → Code → Test → Push → Pull Request
```

### Step by Step

1. **Fork** this repo on GitHub
2. **Clone** your fork locally
3. **Create a branch** from `main`:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```
4. **Make your changes** — write code, test locally
5. **Run checks** before pushing:
   ```bash
   npm run format      # Auto-format code
   npm run lint        # Check for issues
   npm test            # Run tests
   npm run build       # Make sure it builds
   ```
6. **Commit & push:**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat: description of what you did"
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```
7. **Open a Pull Request** on GitHub against `main`
8. CI will run automatically (format → lint → test → build)
9. Once approved — your code gets merged and auto-deployed to production

### Branch Naming

| Type | Format | Example |
|------|--------|---------|
| New feature | `feature/short-description` | `feature/add-search-filter` |
| Bug fix | `fix/short-description` | `fix/login-validation` |
| Docs | `docs/short-description` | `docs/update-readme` |
| Refactor | `refactor/short-description` | `refactor/split-dashboard` |

### Code Style

- **Prettier** handles formatting — just run `npm run format`
- **ESLint** catches issues — run `npm run lint`
- Hebrew for user-facing text, English for code and comments
- Keep components small and focused (one file = one component)

## Deployment

The app auto-deploys to [bayit-community.vercel.app](https://bayit-community.vercel.app) when code is merged to `main`.

- **Vercel** builds and hosts the frontend
- **Firebase** handles auth and database (production keys are set in Vercel env vars)
- Contributors don't need production keys — local dev uses emulators
